This command walks you through a couple of questions and will generate the appropriate [change file](../change-files) in the `/change` directory. The generated file will be checked into the repo automatically for you. One of the niceties of using this utility to generate change files is that it will [check](./check) whether or not you even need a change file or not. Also, it will try to pull in recent commit messages to speed up change file generation.
